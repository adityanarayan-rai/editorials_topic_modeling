# Exploring the Editorial Topics in the Guardian (Jan 1, 2024 - Nov 30, 2024)
This study investigates the thematic structure and narrative depth of The Guardian's editorial content published between January 1, 2024, and November 30, 2024. The research employs two advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques – Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERT embeddings with clustering – to identify and analyze key themes. The findings reveal 15 distinct topics across the editorial corpus, including governance, healthcare, climate change, political dynamics, international conflicts, and social justice. LDA's results highlight overarching themes such as fiscal policies, electoral strategies, and geopolitical conflicts, demonstrating The Guardian's emphasis on systemic issues. BERT complements these insights by uncovering detailed narratives, such as patient experiences in healthcare, cultural reflections, and the complexities of global diplomacy.
